# Entelect Challenge 2019 Visualiser
This is my attempt at a visualiser for the 2019 Entelect Challenge "Worms"

### Entelect Challenge
The Entelect Challenge is an annual coding competition where students, professional developers, and enthusiasts develop an intelligent bot to play a game.

You can find out more at [Entelect Challenge Github Repo](https://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2019-Worms)
And the competition website [here](https://challenge.entelect.co.za/)

### How this works
This visualizer will replay a completed match using the output game states from the game-runner

### Development Notes
